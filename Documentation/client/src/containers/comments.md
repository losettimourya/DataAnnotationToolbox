# `comments.js` Documentation

## Description

The `Comment.js` module is a React component used for displaying and adding comments associated with a specific image. It provides a user interface for users to view existing comments and add new comments to the image.

## Component Overview

- **React Component Name**: `Comment`
- **File Name**: `Comment.js`
- **Dependencies**: `React`, `axios`, `ToastContext` (from `App.js`), `creds`, `TOAST_VARIANTS` (from `toasts/constants`)

## Component Structure

The `Comment` component is structured as follows:

1. **Component State**:
   - Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage component-level state.
   - `content`: Keeps track of the comment content entered by the user.
   - `datasetData`: Stores the retrieved dataset data.
   - `authorId`: Extracts the user's ID from local storage.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - `ToastContext`: The component relies on the `addToast` function from the `ToastContext` for displaying toast notifications.
   - `creds`: Imports credentials or URLs needed for API requests.
   - `TOAST_VARIANTS`: Constants for defining toast variants (e.g., success and error).

3. **Methods**:
   - `submit()`: Sends a POST request to add a new comment to the image.
     - It includes data such as the image ID, comment content, and the author's ID.
     - Displays success or error toasts based on the API response.

4. **Conditional Rendering**:
   - The component's visibility is controlled through the `visible` prop. It is only rendered when `visible` is `true`.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Presents a modal dialog with comments and an input field for adding new comments.
   - Comments retrieved from the `commentdata` prop are displayed.
   - Users can input comments in the input field and add them.
   - A "Close" button is provided to exit the comment dialog.

## Props

- `visible`: A boolean prop that determines whether the comment dialog is visible or hidden.
- `onClose`: A function prop to close the comment dialog.
- `imageid`: The ID of the image for which comments are being displayed.
- `commentdata`: An array of comment data to display within the component.

## Functions

- `setcontent(content: string)`: Sets the `content` state with the provided comment content.

## Usage

The `Comment` component is designed to be used within a web application where users need to view and add comments to images. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing image-related comments.

**Example Usage in a Parent Component:**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Comment from './Comment';

function ImageDetails() {
  const [showCommentDialog, setShowCommentDialog] = useState(false);

  // Define a function to toggle the comment dialog visibility.
  const toggleCommentDialog = () => {
    setShowCommentDialog(!showCommentDialog);
  };

  return (
    <div className="image-details">
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" />
      <button onClick={toggleCommentDialog}>View Comments</button>

      <Comment
        visible={showCommentDialog}
        onClose={toggleCommentDialog}
        imageid={123}
        commentdata={[ /* Array of comments */ ]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
