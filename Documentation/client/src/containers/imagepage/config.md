# `config.js` Documentation

## Description

`config.js` is a module that provides configuration settings for a web application. It typically includes important constants such as URLs, ports, or any other configuration parameters that need to be consistent across the application.

## Configuration

### `BASE_URL: string`

- **Description**: `BASE_URL` is a string constant that represents the base URL of a web service or API that the application interacts with. It is typically used to define the root URL for making network requests.

- **Usage**:
  - `BASE_URL` is used in various parts of the application to construct URLs for making HTTP requests. For example:
    ```javascript
    const apiEndpoint = config.BASE_URL + "/api/data";
    ```

## Notes

- The `config.js` file is a common practice in web development to keep important configuration details in one place.
- By having a centralized configuration file, it's easier to manage and update settings across the application.
- Make sure to import `config` into the modules or components where these configuration parameters are needed.

These configurations help in keeping your code clean and maintainable, allowing you to easily switch between different environments (e.g., development, production) by changing the configuration values in one place.
