# `datasets_assigned.js` Documentation

## Description

`datasets_assigned.js` is a React component used for displaying datasets assigned to the current user. This component fetches data from the backend API and renders it in a table format. It provides information about the assigned projects, such as their ID, name, description, and actions the user can perform.

## Implementation

### Data Fetching

- **Data Retrieval:** The component uses Axios to make an HTTP GET request to the backend API endpoint (`/datasets-my?toVerify=1`) to retrieve the datasets assigned to the current user. The user's authorization token is included in the request headers for authentication.

### Displaying Dataset Information

- **Table Structure:** The retrieved dataset information is displayed in a table format. The table columns include ID, name, description, actions, and created timestamp.
- **Dataset ID:** The dataset IDs are partially displayed, with only the first few characters shown for security reasons. Users can copy the full dataset ID to the clipboard by clicking on the copy icon next to the ID.
- **Description:** Dataset descriptions are truncated to fit the table cell. Users can hover over the description to view the full content in a tooltip.
- **Actions:** Users have the option to view details of the assigned dataset and navigate to the image page for annotation.

## Usage

The `datasets_assigned.js` component is used to display datasets assigned to the current user within the application. It provides an overview of the assigned projects and enables users to access specific dataset details and annotation interfaces.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import DatasetsAssigned from './datasets_assigned'; // Replace with the actual path to your datasets_assigned.js file

function AssignedDatasetsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="assigned-datasets-page">
      <DatasetsAssigned />
      {/* ...other components and content... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

The `datasets_assigned.js` component enhances user experience by providing a clear and organized view of datasets assigned to them. It simplifies dataset management and navigation, allowing users to efficiently access assigned projects and related information.

## Notes

- The component relies on proper authentication to fetch user-specific dataset information.
- Dataset IDs are partially displayed to enhance security and prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information.
- Tooltip functionality is utilized to display full descriptions, ensuring that users can access complete information despite truncation in the table cells.
