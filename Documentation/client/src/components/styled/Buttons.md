# `Buttons.jsx` Documentation

## Description

`Buttons.jsx` defines a set of reusable React button components with various styles. These buttons can be easily integrated into the application to maintain a consistent and visually appealing user interface. The module provides buttons in different colors and styles, including loading buttons with spinners.

## Implementation

The module exports several button components, each with a specific color and style. The buttons are designed with focus and hover effects to enhance user interactivity. Additionally, there is a loading button with a spinner animation to indicate ongoing processes.

- **Button Styles:**
  - The buttons come in different colors, including red, blue, gray, green, yellow, purple, and cyan. Each color has specific hover effects and focus styles for improved user experience.

- **Loading Button:**
  - The module includes a loading button that displays a spinner animation while indicating an ongoing process. This button is useful for asynchronous operations and prevents user interaction during loading.

## Usage

The buttons can be used throughout the application to create interactive elements such as form submissions, actions, and navigational elements. The loading button is especially useful when waiting for server responses or data fetching operations.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './Buttons'; // Replace with the actual path to your Buttons.jsx file

function MyComponent() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // Handle button click logic
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Button.Red onClick={handleButtonClick}>Delete</Button.Red>
      <Button.Blue>Submit</Button.Blue>
      <Button.LoadingHollow onClick={handleButtonClick}>Save Changes</Button.LoadingHollow>
      {/* ...other components... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

The buttons enhance user interaction and provide clear visual cues for clickable elements in the application. They improve accessibility and responsiveness by incorporating focus and hover effects. The loading button ensures a seamless user experience during asynchronous operations.

## Notes

- Customize the button styles and colors to match the application's design system.
- The loading button is particularly useful for actions that require time to complete, such as data fetching or form submissions.
- Ensure consistent use of buttons across the application to maintain a unified user interface.
