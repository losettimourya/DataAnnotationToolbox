# `Containers.jsx` Documentation

## Description

`Containers.jsx` defines a container component used to structure the layout of the discussions page in a React application. The module exports an outer container component, which acts as a wrapper for the discussions page content. The container applies specific styles to maintain consistent spacing and alignment within the discussions page.

## Implementation

The module exports a single outer container component. The component is designed with flexbox properties, providing a vertical layout for the discussions page. It allows for easy arrangement and organization of various elements within the discussions page.

- **Outer Container Styles:**
  - The outer container has predefined styles, including flexbox properties, vertical gap, margin, and padding. These styles ensure a well-structured and visually appealing layout for the discussions page.

## Usage

The outer container component can be utilized as a wrapper for the discussions page content. It provides consistent spacing and alignment, enhancing the overall presentation of the discussions page. Developers can insert different UI elements and components inside this container to create the discussions page layout.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { DiscussionsPage } from './Containers'; // Replace with the actual path to your Containers.jsx file

function Discussions() {
  return (
    <DiscussionsPage.OuterContainer>
      {/* Discussions page content goes here */}
      <h1>Discussions</h1>
      <p>Explore and participate in discussions.</p>
      {/* ...other discussion components... */}
    </DiscussionsPage.OuterContainer>
  );
}
```

## Functionality

The outer container component in `Containers.jsx` simplifies the layout structuring process for the discussions page. It maintains consistent vertical spacing between elements and ensures a visually pleasing arrangement of content. By using this container, developers can focus on building the discussions page's core features without worrying about layout styling intricacies.

## Notes

- Developers can customize the outer container's styles, such as gap, margin, and padding, to match the design requirements of the discussions page.
- Ensure that the outer container is appropriately nested within the discussions page component hierarchy for desired layout effects.
