# `Forms.md` Documentation

## Description

`Forms.md` defines React components for input fields, enabling the creation of customizable and responsive form elements in a web application. The module provides two components: `InputField` and `LargeInputField`, each designed to handle different input scenarios.

## Components

### `InputField`

The `InputField` component renders a standard text input field. It incorporates various CSS classes to style the input field and enhance user experience. Developers can customize the component further by passing additional props.

- **Props:**
  - `className` (Optional): Additional CSS classes to apply to the input field.

- **Usage Example:**

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { InputField } from './Forms'; // Replace with the actual path to your Forms.md file

  function MyForm() {
    return <InputField placeholder="Enter your text" />;
  }
  ```

### `LargeInputField`

The `LargeInputField` component renders a multiline text input field, allowing users to input longer text or multiple lines of content. Similar to `InputField`, it supports customization through additional props.

- **Props:**
  - `rows` (Optional): Specifies the number of visible text lines in the textarea. Defaults to 4.
  - `className` (Optional): Additional CSS classes to apply to the textarea.

- **Usage Example:**

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { LargeInputField } from './Forms'; // Replace with the actual path to your Forms.md file

  function MyForm() {
    return <LargeInputField rows={6} placeholder="Enter your message" />;
  }
  ```

## Functionality

The components in `Forms.md` facilitate the creation of interactive forms within a React application. Developers can utilize these components to capture user input efficiently and style the form elements to match the application's design guidelines.

## Notes

- Developers can extend the provided CSS classes or create custom styles to enhance the appearance of the input fields based on the application's requirements.
- Ensure appropriate validation and error handling mechanisms are implemented in conjunction with these form components for a seamless user experience.
