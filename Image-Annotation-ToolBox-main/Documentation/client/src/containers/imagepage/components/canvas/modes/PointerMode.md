# `PointerMode.js` Documentation

## Description

The `PointerMode.js` file is an essential component for the selection and manipulation of bounding boxes in the annotation application. This component allows users to interact with existing regions, enabling actions such as selecting, deselecting, deleting, adding labels, undo, redo, and fill inside regions.

## Implementation

### Selecting and Deselecting Regions

The primary function of the `PointerMode.js` component is to allow users to select and deselect regions by clicking on them. When the user clicks on a region, it is selected. Clicking on an already selected region deselects it. Selected regions are tracked using a Set, allowing multiple regions to be selected simultaneously.

### Actions on Selected Regions

Once regions are selected, users can perform various actions on them. These actions include:
- Deletion of selected regions.
- Adding labels to selected regions.
- Undo and redo actions to reverse and replay the last changes.
- Filling regions with specific attributes or labels.

### Interaction with Regions

- The component operates within the `Stage` element, enabling precise interaction with regions in the canvas.
- Users can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel to adjust the view.

## Usage

The `PointerMode.js` component is utilized within the application's `Canvas.js` file. It provides the main interface for users to interact with existing annotations, making it an essential tool for manipulating and managing annotations.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PointerMode from './PointerMode'; // Replace with the actual path to your PointerMode.js file

function Canvas({ imagelist, gridsize, tool, imageURL }) {
  const setCanvasMode = (id, imageURL) => {
    switch (id) {
      case 0:
        return <PointerMode imageURL={imageURL} />;
      // Other cases for different tools
      default:
        return <PointerMode imageURL={imageURL} />;
    }
  }

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
        {imagelist.map((item, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            style={{
              width: `${100 / gridsize}%`,
              height: `${100 / gridsize}%`,
              boxSizing: "border-box",
              padding: "4px",
              display: "flex",
              flexDirection: "column",
            }}
          >
            {setCanvasMode(tool.id, item)}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
