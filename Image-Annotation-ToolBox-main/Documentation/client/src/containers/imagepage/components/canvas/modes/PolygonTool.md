# `PolygonTool.js` Documentation

## Description

The `PolygonTool.js` file is responsible for rendering polygonal bounding boxes in the application. It provides users with the ability to create regions of various shapes by drawing vertices and connecting them to form a polygon. This tool is particularly useful for annotating complex shapes and objects within images.

## Implementation

### Drawing Polygonal Regions

The `PolygonTool` component is designed to capture user input for defining polygonal regions. The implementation is based on drawing vertices and connecting them with straight lines to create polygonal shapes. Here's a summary of the key features:

- Clicking on the canvas creates the first vertex of the polygon.
- Subsequent clicks add more vertices and draw the edges.
- When a polygon is complete (closed), it forms a region within the image.
- Users can create multiple polygonal regions within a single image.

### Usage

The `PolygonTool.js` component is utilized within the `Canvas.js` file, which provides different tools and modes for display on the canvas. When the "Polygon" tool is selected, this component is responsible for rendering polygonal bounding boxes. It can be integrated into a grid layout to display multiple images with polygonal annotations.

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PolygonTool from './PolygonTool'; // Replace with the actual path to your PolygonTool.js file

function Canvas({ imagelist, gridsize, tool, imageURL }) {
  const setCanvasMode = (id, imageURL) => {
    switch (id) {
      case 1:
        return <PolygonTool imageURL={imageURL} />;
      // Other cases for different tools
      default:
        return <PointerMode imageURL={imageURL} />;
    }
  }

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "row", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
        {imagelist.map((item, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            style={{
              width: `${100 / gridsize}%`,
              height: `${100 / gridsize}%`,
              boxSizing: "border-box",
              padding: "4px",
              display: "flex",
              flexDirection: "column",
            }}
          >
            {setCanvasMode(tool.id, item)}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
