# `Navbar.jsx` Documentation

## Description

`Navbar.jsx` is a React functional component representing the navigation bar of a web application. It provides navigation links and user-related functionality based on the user's login state. The component handles responsive design with a menu icon for smaller screens.

## Import Statements

- `React`: For creating React components.
- `useState`: For managing component-level state.
- `"./Navbar.css"`: External CSS file for styling the navigation bar.
- `Link, useNavigate`: From `react-router-dom` for creating navigation links and programmatically navigating to different routes.
- `getUser, getUserLoginState, USER_STATE`: Custom utility functions/constants for handling user authentication state.
- `RiMenu3Line, RiCloseLine`: Icons from `react-icons/ri` used for menu toggle.

## Component Structure

- **State Variables:**
  - `toggleMenu`: Boolean state variable to track the visibility of the menu dropdown on smaller screens.

- **Functionality:**
  - The component checks the user's login state and renders appropriate navigation links and user-related content accordingly.
  - It provides a responsive design where the menu icon (`RiMenu3Line`) toggles a dropdown menu on smaller screens, displaying navigation links and user-related content.

## Component Logic

- The component checks the `userLoginState` to determine if the user is logged in or not.
- If the user is logged in, it shows the user's name, a "Dashboard" link, and a logout button.
- If the user is not logged in, it shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" links.

## Usage

The `Navbar` component is typically used within the main layout of the application to provide navigation options to the users. It ensures a consistent user experience by displaying relevant links based on the user's login state.

## Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Navbar from './Navbar'; // Replace with the actual path to your Navbar.jsx file

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Navbar />
      {/* ...other components and routes... */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `getUser` and `getUserLoginState` functions are correctly implemented and return appropriate user data and login states.
- Customize the navigation links and user-related functionality based on the application's specific requirements.
