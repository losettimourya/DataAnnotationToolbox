# `Navbar.js` Documentation

## Description

`Navbar.js` provides a responsive navigation bar component for the application. It includes menus, buttons, and links for seamless navigation between different sections of the application. The navigation bar also provides user authentication functionality, allowing users to log in, log out, and view notifications.

## Components and Functions

### 1. `Navbar2` Component

The `Navbar2` component represents the navigation bar of the application. It provides a responsive design and includes the following elements:

- **Mobile Menu Button:** Displays a menu button (hamburger icon) for mobile devices to toggle the menu visibility.
- **Logo:** Displays the application logo, providing a link to the home page.
- **Navigation Links:** Displays navigation links such as "My Data Page," "Datasets," and "Dataset Versions." These links allow users to navigate to different sections of the application.
- **Notifications Icon:** Displays a bell icon for viewing notifications. Clicking the icon can trigger notifications functionality.
- **User Authentication:** Provides user authentication features, including login/logout functionality and user profile settings. Users can log in with different user accounts and switch between them.

#### Responsive Design

- The navigation bar adjusts its layout and appearance based on the screen size.
- On smaller screens (mobile devices), a mobile menu button is displayed to access the menu items.
- On larger screens (desktops), the navigation links are displayed in a horizontal layout.

#### User Authentication

- Users can log in and log out using the "Login" and "Logout" buttons.
- When logged in, users can switch between different user accounts using the "Login as User 1" and "Login as User 2" options.
- User login state is stored in the local storage (`localStorage`).

### 2. `setLoginState(userid = null)` Function

The `setLoginState` function is an asynchronous function that sets the user login state. It accepts a `userid` parameter and stores it in the local storage (`localStorage`). This function is used for user authentication and managing user sessions.

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Navbar2 } from './path/to/Navbar'; // Replace with the actual path to your Navbar.js file

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar2 />
      {/* Other components and content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the paths to the images and icons used in the component are correct and accessible.
- Customize the navigation links and authentication functionality based on the application's requirements.
- This component relies on external styles and libraries (Tailwind CSS and Headless UI) for its appearance and behavior. Make sure to include these dependencies in your project for proper rendering.
