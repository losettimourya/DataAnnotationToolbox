# `desc.js` Documentation

## Description

`Desc_my_datasets.js` exports a React component responsible for displaying detailed information about a specific dataset. The component retrieves dataset information from the backend API using the provided `dataset_id` and presents it in a structured table format. It includes details such as Dataset ID, Name, Description, Created At timestamp, Total Images, Images needing review, Images under review, Images accepted, and Images unassigned.

## Implementation

The component makes use of the Axios library to fetch dataset information from the backend API. It handles success and error cases, displaying appropriate toasts for user feedback. Dataset details are displayed in a table format with various columns.

- **Input Parameters:**
  - `dataset_id`: ID of the dataset for which information is to be displayed.

## Functionality

The component provides an overview of the specified dataset, including its ID, name, description, creation timestamp, and image-related statistics. It dynamically updates the image-related statistics based on the dataset's current state, such as the number of images needing review, under review, accepted, and unassigned.

## Notes

- Ensure that the backend API endpoint specified in the `creds.mysqlUrl` and `config.BASE_URL` variables is correct and accessible.
- Customize the displayed dataset information as per the requirements of the application.
- Implement proper loading states and error handling for a seamless user experience.
